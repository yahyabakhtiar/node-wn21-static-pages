  That was indeed the case at the end of the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft on Thursday night, when the Seahawks traded the final pick in the opening round to the Minnesota Vikings. The Seahawks trading out of the first round was not a surprise, it was just a matter of which team would want to jump back into the round to select one of the remaining quarterbacks.<br>

It was, as it turned out, the Vikings. They selected Louisville QB Teddy Bridgewater, while the Seahawks moved down eight spots – and then traded that 40th pick overall to the Detroit Lions, moving down five spots and also adding picks in the fourth and seventh rounds. <br>

But back to the top – or bottom of the top, as was the case. For passing on making a selection in the first round, the Seahawks ended up with four players. First, there was Colorado wide receiver Paul Richardson at No. 45. The Seahawks then traded the fourth-round pick they got from the Vikings (No. 111 overall) to the Cincinnati Bengals for their pick in the fourth round (123) and a seventh-round pick (199), which were used to draft Alabama wide receiver Kevin Norwood and Marshall tackle Garrett Scott. At No. 227 overall, with the seventh-round pick from the Lions, the Seahawks selected Arkansas fullback Kiero Small.<br>

In Minnesota, meanwhile, there were some who thought the Vikings gave up too much to move up for Bridgewater. But general manager Rick Spielman was not among them. </section>
