	<h2> About </h2> 
    The NFL Draft is in the rearview mirror. So is the rookie minicamp. And then there was last week’s whirlwind trip to that other Washington so the Super Bowl champion Seahawks could be honored by President Barack Obama.

But you know the mantra around Virginia Mason Athletic Center: What’s next?

After an extended Memorial Day weekend, the players and coaches return on Tuesday for the first of the team’s 10 OTA sessions – a three-week process that leads into the full-squad minicamp June 17-19. And then there’s the not-so-little event where the bling will be the thing.

“The White House trip is the latest reward for winning the Super Bowl, until we get out rings,” nose tackle Brandon Mebane said last week. “That’s the best part.”




But first comes the part that was a prelude to all the good things that happened to the Seahawks – and all the good things the Seahawks made happen – in the past 12 months. A year ago, they were being heralded as the NFC favorite to advance to the Super Bowl. Because of the exemplary way the players handled the hype, they did advance to Super Bowl XLVIII and dispatched the Denver Broncos – “By 35 points,” as President Obama underlined during his remarks on Wednesday.
